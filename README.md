# 2D_Array_AI_Game
Array-based game against an artificial intelligence.

Project was built to have a rudimentary artificial intelligence find the best moves possible in an array-based tile game where the object was to 
cause the opponent to run out of moves. AI was then put up against other AI's by typing in the moves determined by the other AI's manually. Should 
also be able to play against a human player.
